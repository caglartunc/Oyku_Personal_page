	I am a fifth-year Ph. D. candidate in the Management and Global Business department at Rutgers Business School under a Fulbright Fellowship. I teach Ethics in Business to undergraduate students and work as a Behavioral Lab Coordinator. My current research focuses on employee voice behaviors. My dissertation examines the role of moral character and organizational ethical climate in understanding employees’ whistleblowing behaviors from a virtue ethics perspective. My research in progress includes examining the role of normative deliberation on ethical decision making, promoting effective whistleblowing, and exploring technology firms’ role as facilitators of expression and suppression of voice.
