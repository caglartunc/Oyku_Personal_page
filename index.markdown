	I am an Assistant Professor of Management at Sabancı Business School. I have recently completed my doctoral studies in Management and Global Business department at Rutgers Business School under a Fulbright Fellowship. In my dissertation, I explored the role of moral character and organizational ethical climate in understanding employees’ whistleblowing behaviors from a virtue ethics perspective. My current research focuses on examining the role of normative deliberation on ethical decision making, promoting effective whistleblowing, and exploring technology firms’ role as facilitators of expression and suppression of voice.
